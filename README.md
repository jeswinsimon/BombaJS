# BombaJS
An Automatic JS-Based State Computing Framework.

The name "BombaJS" was chosen to pay homage to one of the finest historical work on computation and cryptography that paved way to Turing Machines and beyond where we exist and continue to model our world upon.

Deepest Homage to those war heroes led by Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki, Henryk Zygalski, Alan Turing and many others at Bletchley Park who fought our war, without fightng it, with their intellect and relentless pursuit for excellence and survival.
